It is an application development framework for enterprise Java(J2EE).
There is an extension for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform.
Spring is a framework for dependency injection which is the pattern that allowed to build a very decoupled system.
The goal of spring is to make J2EE development easier to use and promote good programming practice.

Letâ€™s look at some advantages of Spring Framework:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Framework can be employed on all architectural layers used in the development of web applications;
Uses the very lightweight POJO model when writing classes;
Allows you to freely link modules and easily test them;
Supports declarative programming;
Eliminates the need to independently create factory and singleton classes;
Supports various configuration methods;
Provides middleware-level service.
Despite the many advantages of Spring Framework, the lengthy preparation process involved in configuring it has contributed to the creation of Spring Boot.
